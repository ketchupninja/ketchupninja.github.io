    <article>Ivory-tower philosophers have long debated: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox">When</a> is a 'heap' no longer a 'heap'? What makes one a 'good person'? <a href = "https://href.li/?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto">What</a> exactly <i>is</i> a 'planet'?

            Of course, right-thinking down-to-earth folk know the answers: twelve items make a heap, being in the 50th percentile of conscientiousness given your time period, wealth and status makes you a good person, and orbiting the sun makes something a planet.  These answers were handed down directly from the legendary sphinx that dwells in a golden temple in the heart of the great jungle.

            The Category-Keeper decides, in its heavenly wisdom, the exact definitions of all words and categories. It neatly files away every single edge case and oddball into clear-cut groups. 
            
            Myths handed down through generations say that if one made the journey to its lair and bested it in a round of combat, it would grant that person admission or exemption to one category. They would be the lone exception to the unyielding definitions that bound everything else in the universe.

            Today, someone finally completed that journey. They'd spent weeks carving through vines the size of oak trees, navigating based on the stars, old tales heard from friends-of-friends-of-friends, and more than a few completely wild guesses. Just as they were running low on supplies and planning to turn back empty-handed - they saw it. A towering temple constructed of pure gold. 
            
            They climbed the grand stairs, and entered into the vast interior chamber. Pillars with intricate inscriptions surrounded a massive beast, resting on a heap of pillows that would still be a heap if you were to subtract a thousand pillows from it. 
            
            As the explorer's footsteps echoed through the chamber, one of the beast's eyes flicked open. It yawned like a house cat.
            
            "Mm...why are you here?" It mumbled with a volume that shook the room despite the innocuous words.
        
            "Er, I came...to challenge you! For the right to become an exception!" They had come too far to back out now.
            
            "Oh...alright." The sphinx rose to its full height, towering over the explorer, and they realized they had made a terrible mistake. 
            
            They were expecting the journey to have been the <i>real</i> challenge, and to receive their reward after a brief motivational speech on the virtues of determination and perseverance. It was looking more and more like they had to actually beat the ancient guardian in a fight. This was very bad. The machete they'd brought was a toothpick to this thing, if they even got the chance to use it. They'd never be able to run fast enough to escape.
            
            As the sphinx raised a paw to cut the explorer with its claws, or perhaps simply crush them, they shut their eyes in resignation. They thought about how, all things considered, they'd led a pretty good life. 
            
            One second passed. Another.
            
            Five.
            
            Ten.
            
            Hesitantly, as if it would break the stasis and put their death back on schedule, they opened their eyes. The sphinx was asleep again. They were unharmed. The unlikely survivor was dumbfounded. Should they just...leave? Curiosity and confusion made them speak before their brain caught up.

            "Um...great sphinx?" 
            
            "Yes?" It groaned without moving.
            
            "I thought we were going to have, like, a duel?" 
            
            "We did. You closed your eyes and I killed you." 
            
            "Oh. Well, I think you messed up. I'm not dead."
            
            "Nope. You're super dead."
            
            "But I'm still moving around and breathing and stuff."
            
            "Fire consumes oxygen and moves. It isn't alive. So those thing don't prove that you're alive." 
            
            "But I can talk!"
            
            "Recordings of voices aren't alive. See above."
            
            "That's - you're just being an asshole. I still have an internal conscious experience!"
            
            "There's no way you can prove that to me. Listen, buddy, you're <i>definitely</i> 'dead'. I put you in the category myself."
            
            "You made the classification 'dead' apply to me, but didn't hurt me, wound me, or otherwise negatively affect the health of my body?"
            
            "Yup." 
            
            "...Can I still ask for your boon?"
            
            "I don't see why not."
            
            So the explorer got their wish.
            
            ---
            
            And realized that it didn't matter. They had never cared about the words or categories themselves - they wanted to use words to talk about things. The entire journey had been misguided. At least they'd learned something. 
            
            As the explorer turned to leave, one last thought occurred to them.
            
            "Are you even a heaven-sent divine beast?"
            
            "No. Please stop coming to my temple."
