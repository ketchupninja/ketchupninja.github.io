      <article>Imagine you're an old-timey farmer, and someone promised you five cows in exchange for $30. This is a great deal, you accept, and then they bring you five baseball caps with bull horns on them. You're outraged, and demand to know what kind of joke this is.
            
            But they insist they're serious. A few weeks back, these new novelty caps called “cows” became a huge fad in the area, to such an extent that the word “cow” is understood by everyone to refer to the hat, and not to the animal. Now when people want to refer to the animal, they call it a “farm cow”.
            
            Because the promise was for the transfer of five cows, not five farm cows, all of this is above board. You sullenly accept your five novelty hats.
            
            What are you going to do, say that actually the word “cow” means “black and white farm animal”? We all know that words don't have <a href = "fiction/categorykeeper.html"> objective meanings handed down from on high </a>, and that a word means whatever people use it to mean.
            
            This illustrates the foundational principle of Market Linguistics.
            
            Accepting a promise from someone else means that you are <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp"> long </a> on the words used in the promise. If those words shift over time and mean less than they used to, you lose value. If they come to mean more, you gain value. 
            
            Conversely, making a promise to someone else is to be <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp">short </a>on the words used in the promise. If the words you used to make the promise come to mean less, then you have less obligation to the other person and gain value. And vice versa if the words come to mean more.
            
            This fluctuating value allows investors to fund promises containing words that they think will increase in value.
            
            The more popular a word is, the more people use it, and so the more people whose behavior must be changed in order to alter the word's value. Causing a word to enter common usage is thus an extremely effective strategy to hedge risk.
            
            Some early investors tried to bribe dictionary writers in an attempt to manipulate words' meanings, but this was a waste of money - no one other than people arguing on the internet use dictionaries to determine what words mean.
            
            Some words have so much fluctuation in their accepted meaning that a volatility trading market has formed. You'll see people daytrading words like “Justice”, "God", and “Art”, words whose meanings can vary drastically from sentence to sentence. It's a risky business, but if you're fast and clever, you can make some serious money.
            
            There was a thriving investment ecosystem until a billion-dollar hedge fund shorted the word “word”. This started a chain-reaction of panic that tanked the value of the entire language. No one wanted to put more money in after that. (The original hedge fund made a huge profit, of course.)
            
            Thankfully, investors “learned” their “lesson”, and things like that don't “happen” anymore.
