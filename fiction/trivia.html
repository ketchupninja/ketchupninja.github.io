      <article>One strange modifier is “Actual”. It is by far the rarest modifier, and has no effect on the stats or appearance of any pet species, similar to the “Normal” modifier. If presented with a pet bearing the “Actual” modifier, the Pet Inspector usually gives the default response for a 0% catalogued species. 
            
      However, if every Snapshot has been found and the 8 Overtime Challenges have all been completed, the Inspector gives unique dialogue: “I guess some part of (Pet Name) is scared to change.” Subsequent presentations of the same pet yield no response.
