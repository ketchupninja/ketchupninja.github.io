    <snippet>“What? Who the heck told you that?”
            
            “No one 'told me anything', I thought of it myself.”
            
            “Ha, ha. Yeah. I get it. But no, really, who told you that?”</snippet>

    <snippet>“It seems kind of messed up that when you imagine 'a person with a soul', you imagine someone who is very good at their job.”

            “It seems kind of messed that you think that 'the thing you spend most of your life doing' is totally irrelevant.”</snippet>

    <snippet>“Well, would you stop following incentives if I gave you $20?” </snippet>

    <snippet>“I'm done being virtuous in silence.”

            “You're going to start being virtuous loudly?”
            
            “No, I'm going to stop being virtuous.”</snippet>

    <snippet>“Oh, wow, that's a huge relief. I thought our lives were on the line.”

            “Ha ha, yeah, it was just - wait, <i>that's</i> how you would act if our lives were on the line?!” </snippet>

    <snippet>“Mister Bond, how does it feel to be six standard deviations to the right of the mean along the 'currently caught in my evil trap' axis?</snippet>

    <snippet> “Well, people aren't rocks.”
            
            “I dunno, I think I've gotten pretty close.”</snippet>

    <snippet>“…and I think that would be for the best.”

            “Are you sure you're informed enough to have a useful opinion on this? Like, have you ever even left your house?

            “Well, a bunch of other people have left their house, and they don't seem to have gotten anywhere.”</snippet>

    <snippet>“It's a shame that they died right before I was born, because that's around the time things started getting interesting.”</snippet>

    <snippet>“I don't know what I've been told - “

            “Uh, the line is actually ‘I don't know but I've been told.' ”
            
            “Oh, that too.”</snippet>

    <snippet>“You shouldn't compare yourself to them.”
            
            “Don't worry, I'm not comparing myself with them.”
            
            “Good.”
            
            “I'm contrasting myself with them."</snippet>    

    <snippet>“People are being influenced by the propagation of misinformation!”

            “imagine thinking people are influenced by information, LMAO”</snippet>

    <snippet>“It really gets to me how everyone ignores their own flaws to focus on those of others. We assign blame to others but dodge it ourselves.”

            “I know, right? What we need is a population that truly understands their own faults. A population that is aware, at all times, of their own utter repugnance. A collective psyche that knows it has failed, and-”
            
            “What are you talking about? We need to be aware of our flaws and <i>strive to be better.</i>”
            
            “Um, too late?”</snippet>

    <snippet>“I used to be acquaintances with some folks trying to save the world. They were odd, but they had a certain charm.

            I haven't seen them in a while.
            
            …
            
            Say, is it getting darker outside?”</snippet>

    <snippet> I am sitting in the desert. A wrench in my left hand, a pirated copy of <i>Criminal Law for Exceptionally Slow Children</i> open in my right. My car is disassembled, on each piece a tiny piece of tape saying ‘NOT REALLY TRYING’. Above me, something is eating the stars.

            “I am beginning to suspect,” I say as another star disappears, “that I made a mistake somewhere.”</snippet>
